This is the Demo of the Logstash to collect and analyze the Logs from (.log) files and applu some filteration and stored into elasticsearch.
In Logstash we have total 3 Parts
     ** 1)Input
     **2)Output
     3)Filter**
    
We can add input as a .log file or get logs from Filebeats(ELK Stack) and analyze logs
In filter we can apply different types of filters as per need.**(https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/filter-plugins.html)**
In output we can define port of elasticsearch running and define custom index name.
